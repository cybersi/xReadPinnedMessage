Step 1: Create a New Bot on Telegram
Open Telegram App:

Make sure you have the Telegram app installed and you're logged in.
Find BotFather:

BotFather is an official bot that helps you create and manage your bots.
Create a New Bot:

Type /newbot and follow the instructions.
Provide a name for your bot (e.g., MyAwesomeBot).
Choose a unique username for your bot (must end with bot, e.g., MyAwesomeBot_bot).
