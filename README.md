**Simple Telegram Bot to reply based on ID pattern**

## Step 1: Create a New Bot on Telegram

1. **Open Telegram App:**
   - Make sure you have the Telegram app installed and you're logged in.

2. **Find BotFather:**
   - Search for BotFather in the search bar and start a chat with it.
     BotFather is an official bot that helps you create and manage your bots.

3. **Create a New Bot:**
   - Type `/newbot` and follow the instructions.
   - Provide a name for your bot (e.g., MyAwesomeBot).
   - Choose a unique username for your bot (must end with bot, e.g., MyAwesomeBot_bot).

4. **Get Your API Token:**
   - After creating the bot, BotFather will give you a token (a string of characters).
   - Save this token; you'll need it to authenticate and control your bot.

## Installation

Install the `python-telegram-bot` library using pip:

```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot
